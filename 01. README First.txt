Supplemental Material - Patterns and processes in fish terrestrial biomechanics: Biomechanics and neural control of fish terrestrial locomotion

This repository contains the r-code (LutekEtAl_SupCode.rmd) and data files (Table1_PhylogenyData.xlsx, actinopt_12k_treePL.tre) to run the analysis and generate the figures used in the above paper.

NOTE that actinopt_12k_treePL.tre was downloaded from The Fish Tree of Life website (https://fishtreeoflife.org/downloads/). For more information about this tree, please visit their website (https://fishtreeoflife.org/about/).

TO RUN CODE
Please be sure that "Table1_PhylogenyData.xlsx" and "actinopt_12k_treePL.tre" are in the same file folder as LutekEtAl_SupCode.rmd before opening the r-notebook.
